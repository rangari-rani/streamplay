## 📚 About This Project

Originally created during MCA (2022), this music player project was an early exercise in mastering React state, media playback logic, and responsive UI.

While lightweight and fully frontend, it reflects strong fundamentals in:
- Centralized playback control using React Context
- Custom seek bar and play/pause toggling
- Component-based structure with conditional rendering
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

> 🕒 Organized and published later for clarity, learning, and portfolio presentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** – Dynamic frontend UI
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Utility-first CSS for styling
- No backend or API — **songs and metadata are embedded locally**

## 🔄 What Came Next  

This project helped me explore dynamic UI state, audio controls, and React context in a focused setting.  

After this, I began building **full-stack applications** with **ReactJS** and **Spring Boot**, adding real API integrations, role-based auth, database persistence, and modular monolithic structures.
